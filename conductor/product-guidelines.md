# Product Guidelines: Soil

## Tone & Voice
- **Serious Game:** Soil is classified as a "Serious Game," specifically designed for education and training in agricultural and ecological resource management.
- **Encouraging & Academic:** The application should use a supportive and guiding tone. Terminology should be precise and scientifically accurate to maintain educational integrity, while remaining accessible to casual players.
- **Scientifically Grounded:** All guidance and feedback should be rooted in real-world agricultural data and research, providing a bridge between simulation and reality.

## Visual Identity
- **Natural & Earthy Palette:** Prioritize greens, browns, and soft blues to reinforce the agricultural and ecological themes.
- **Unified Aesthetic:** Maintain a consistent look and feel across Web, iOS, and Android platforms, using custom-designed components that prioritize clarity and educational value.

## UX & Interaction Principles
- **Offline-First Resilience:** Core gameplay must be available without an internet connection. State synchronization should be handled seamlessly in the background when connectivity is restored.
- **Hybrid Execution Logic:** Maintain identical game engine logic in both Frontend (for immediate offline feedback) and Backend (for authoritative multiplayer state), ensuring a consistent experience regardless of connectivity.
- **Inclusive Accessibility:** Continuous adherence to WCAG standards. This includes high-contrast ratios, screen reader compatibility, and large touch targets to support a diverse range of students and players.
- **Direct Feedback:** Use in-game overlays (e.g., changes in soil color) to provide immediate, intuitive feedback on ecological impact.
- **Analytical Depth:** Supplement direct feedback with visual dashboards (charts, heatmaps) for in-depth analysis of financial and ecological trends.
- **Narrative Insights:** Integrate "AI Advisor" reports to provide descriptive, narrative summaries of game progress and ecological status.

## Onboarding & Support
- **Learning-by-Doing:** Encourage exploration by providing "just-in-time" guidance rather than long, upfront tutorials.
- **Comprehensive Reference:** Maintain and link to the existing User Manual for detailed mechanics and rules.
- **Research Transparency:** Provide access to the scientific research and real-life data that informs the game's simulation logic.
