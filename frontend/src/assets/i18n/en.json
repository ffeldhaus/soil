    "paragraph1": "The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 declared \"sustainability\" a global development goal. This is to be achieved through an integrative view of economic, ecological, and social issues, enabling a fair distribution of life chances between current and future generations.",
    "paragraph2": "The German Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs (KMK) therefore considers it a central task of schools to \"enable students to actively shape an ecologically compatible, economically efficient, and socially just environment\" (KMK, 2007, p. 1).",
    "paragraph3": "To convey the idea of sustainability based on a cohesive view of economy and ecology, the simulation game \"Soil\" was developed. In this game, students engage with the topic of agriculture. They are tasked with establishing a permanently productive agricultural operation in groups over ten (now configurable, e.g., 15) game rounds.",
    "paragraph4": "To achieve this goal, groups can steer the development of their farm by planting crops and choosing different cultivation methods. Feedback on the ecological and economic impacts of their decisions is provided after each game round. Based on this feedback, they can assess the success of their strategy and modify it if necessary.",
    "paragraph5": "This way, learners can discover the centrality of ecological variables as natural limits to their economic activities in a hands-on manner and thus learn to understand and manage sustainable development processes.",
    "paragraph6": "Further background information and complete game materials are available for download in the internal area of the homepage (for registered administrators). New games can also be created and managed there. Access to the internal area requires registration as a game administrator.",
